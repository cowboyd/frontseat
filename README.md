## Choose who sits in the front seat

This program chooses who gets to sit in the frontseat in the event that
Niilo and Saarra cannot come to an agreement between themselves. Because there
is an advantage to being older, a slight bump in probability is given based on
age. However, as age increases, this probabilistic advantage decreases
asymptotically to 50%

To choose who gets to sit in the front seat, run `deno task choose`. For
example:

``` shellsession
$ deno task choose
Niilo Probability 0.5416666666666666
Saara Probability 0.4583333333333333
seed 19f270d6-534c-47fe-9c7d-18e1758ba2da
trial 0.2827389684971422


====> Niilo
```
